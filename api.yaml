      summary: 'Entity Extraction'
      description: 'This is a named entity extraction & linking API that performs very well even on short texts, on which many other similar services do not. It currently works on texts in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and many other languages. With this API you will be able to automatically tag your texts, extracting Wikipedia entities and enriching your data.'
      operationId: getEntities
      consumes:
        - application/json
      produces:
        - application/json
      parameters:

          required: false
        - name: url
          description: use "url" when you have an URL and you want the Entity Extraction API to work on its main content; it will fetch the URL for you, and use an AI algorithm to extract the relevant part of the document to work on; in this case, the main content will also be returned by the API to allow you to properly use the annotation offsets
          type: string
          in: query
          required: false
        - name: html
          description: use "html" when you have an HTML document and you want the Entity Extraction API to work on its main content, similarly to what the "url" parameter does.

          in: query
        - name: html_fragment
          description: use "html_fragment" when you have an HTML snippet and you want the Entity Extraction API to work on its content. It will remove all HTML tags before analyzing it.

        - name: lang
          description: The language of the text to be annotated; currently English, French, German, Italian and Portuguese are supported. Leave this parameter out to let the Entity Extraction API automatically detect the language for you.
          type: string
          in: query
        - name: country
          description: This parameter specifies the country which we assume VAT and telephone numbers to be coming from. This is important to get correct results, as different countries may adopt different formats.
